Write a requirements document for two programs:
- One that writes the current date/time to a file every 10 seconds and
- Another one that runs every 7 seconds and reads the last logged entry from that file and prints it to the console.
Write it down in a markdown format.

Write the list of tasks required to implement those requirements. Use a JSON format for that.
